                Scaling is a dental cleaning procedure that specifically targets
                the removal of dental plaque and tartar (calculus) from the
                surfaces of teeth. Dental plaque is a soft, sticky film that
                forms on teeth and contains bacteria. If plaque is not removed
                through regular oral hygiene practices such as brushing and
                flossing, it can mineralize and harden into tartar.
                <br />
                <br />
                If dental plaque is not regularly removed through effective oral
                hygiene practices, it can lead to various oral health issues and
                contribute to the development of dental problems.
                <br />
                <br />
                This cleaning procedure is typically performed using specialized
                instruments, such as ultrasonic scalers or hand scalers. It
                involves carefully scraping away the plaque and tartar from the
                tooth surfaces, including both above and below the gumline. This
                helps prevent and treat gum diseases like gingivitis and
                periodontitis.

              <li class="list-text">Deep Scaling/Periodontal Treatment</li>
              <p class="text">
                Deep scaling which is also known as deep cleaning or root
                planing, is a dental procedure that goes beyond the standard
                dental cleaning to treat more advanced stages of gum disease,
                such as periodontitis. Periodontitis is characterized by
                inflammation and infection of the gums, which can lead to the
                loss of supporting bone around the teeth if left untreated.
                <br />
                <br />
                Deep scaling typically involves two main components in its'
                procedure.
                <br />
                <br />
                1. Scaling
                <br />
                <br />
                Similar to the standard scaling procedure, the dental
                professional removes plaque and tartar from the tooth surfaces,
                both above and below the gumline. This is performed using
                specialized instruments and tools like ultrasonic scalers and
                hand scalers.
                <br />
                <br />
                2. Root Planing
                <br />
                <br />
                This step involves smoothing the surfaces of the tooth roots to
                remove bacterial toxins and promote the reattachment of the gums
                to the teeth. This helps eliminate rough areas on the roots
                where bacteria can collect.
                <br />
                <br />
                The goal of deep scaling is to reduce inflammation, control
                infection, and prevent further progression of gum disease. Deep
                scaling is an essential part of periodontal treatment and is
                usually followed by more frequent maintenance cleanings to
                manage and maintain the condition of the patient's dental and
                oral health.
