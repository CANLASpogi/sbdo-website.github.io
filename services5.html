                Dentures are removable dental prosthetics designed to 
                replace missing teeth and surrounding tissues. 
                They come in two main types: complete dentures, 
                which replace all teeth in an arch, and partial dentures,
                which replace only a few missing teeth and are attached to 
                the remaining natural teeth.
                <br>
                <br>
                Dental crowns, also known as caps, are prosthetic devices 
                that encase or cover a damaged or weakened tooth to restore its 
                shape, size, strength, and appearance. Crowns are often made from 
                materials like porcelain, ceramic, metal, or a combination of these.

              <p class="text">
             Removable dentures are dental prosthetics that can be taken out of 
             the mouth by the wearer. They are designed to replace missing teeth 
             and surrounding tissues, offering a removable and temporary solution for 
              individuals who have lost some or all of their natural teeth.
              <br>
              <br>
          Full dentures, also known as complete dentures, are removable prosthetic
          devices that replace all the teeth in one or both dental arches (upper or lower).
          They are made of acrylic or a combination of acrylic and metal and are designed to 
          be taken out for cleaning and maintenance.
              <br>
              <br>
                Partial dentures are removable prosthetics designed to replace one or more missing teeth 
                and are attached to the remaining natural teeth. 
                They consist of replacement teeth attached to a framework that 
                clasps onto the remaining natural teeth.
                They can be made with a metal or 
                acrylic framework.
              <br>
              <br>
          The specific procedure and adjustments may vary based on the type of denture chosen, 
          whether full or partial, and the individual patient's needs.

              <li class="list-text">Fixed Partial Dentures</li>
              <p class="text">
                Fixed partial dentures, commonly known as dental bridges,
                are prosthetic devices that are permanently attached to natural teeth or
                dental implants. 
                Unlike removable dentures, fixed partial dentures are not meant
                to be taken out by the wearer.
                <br>
            <br>
                The primary purpose of fixed partial dentures is to replace missing teeth, 
                restoring both function and aesthetics.
                They help individuals regain the ability to chew food and speak more effectively.
                By filling the gap left by missing teeth, bridges help prevent adjacent natural teeth from shifting out of position.
                Bridges also provide support to facial muscles and can help maintain the natural shape of the face.
