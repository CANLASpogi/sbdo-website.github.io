                Direct and Indirect Composite Restorations
              </li>
              <p class="text">
                Composite restorations are versatile tooth coloured filling
                materials composed of strong plastic and glass particles that
                are used by our dentists or dental therapists to seal deep
                fissures, fill cavities, and sometimes restore extensively
                broken down teeth.
                <br />
                <br />
                In direct tooth restoration, all of the work is done and
                completed within the mouth. The procedure is commonly referred
                to as filling and it involves the placement of a malleable
                substance into a prepared and cleaned cavity. The material is
                then hardened to restore the structure (and sometimes
                appearance) of the damaged tooth.
                <br />
                <br />
                We offer both direct and indirect restorations for your dental
                needs.

              <li class="list-text">Glass Ionomer</li>
              <p class="text">Glass Ionomers or Glass Ionomer Cement (GIC) are restorative 
                materials which can also be used as base for a composite resin overlay where 
                the remaining tooth structure is unsupported and requires a bonded composite 
                to maintain its structural integrity.

              <li class="list-text">Sealants</li>
              <p class="text"> Sealants are a thin protective coating created from plastic and other
                dental materials which can be used over areas of early decay preventing further 
                damage to your tooth.

              <li class="list-text">Inlays and Onlays</li>
              <p class="text">
                A dental inlay is made of a solid material that is custom-fit to your tooth. 
                It's usually used to fill the space in the center of your tooth that has been 
                damaged by decay or injury. 
               A dental onlay in the other hand, are made of a solid material that is custom-fit to your tooth. 
                They can also be shaped and colored to match your natural teeth. An onlay is larger than an inlay
                but smaller than a dental crown. It is used to fill a larger cavity that extends over the cusps of a tooth.
                Dental onlays are generally used to repair more extensive damage. They are often recommended if you have a large 
                cavity extending beyond the tooth's center.

              <li class="list-text">Veneers</li>
              <p class="text">
              Veneers are thin, custom-made shells typically made 
              of porcelain or composite resin that are designed to 
              cover the front surface of teeth. These shells are 
              bonded to the teeth to improve their appearance and address 
              various cosmetic concerns. They are a popular cosmetic dentistry 
              option for individuals seeking a long-lasting and natural-looking 
              solution to improve the appearance of their teeth.
              <br>
              <br>
              Veneers are used for many purposes such as cosmetic improvement, alignment and spacing, and reshaping.
              Veneers are primarily used to improve the appearance of teeth by addressing issues such as discoloration, stains, chips, 
              cracks, or irregularities in size and shape.
              They can be used to create the illusion of straighter teeth and close gaps between teeth, providing a 
              more uniform and aesthetically pleasing smile.
              They can be applied to alter the size, length, or 
              shape of teeth, creating a harmonious and balanced smile.
