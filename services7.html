			<p class = "text">
			A tooth extraction is a dental procedure during which 
			your tooth is completely removed from its socket. 
			<br>
			<br>
			These can be either simple or complicated extractions.
			<br>
			<br>
			Simple dental extraction involves the removal of teeth 
			that are visible in the mouth. These can be carried out 
			without the need for an incision or any 
			other special tooth removal techniques. 
			<br>
			<br>
			A complicated or most commonly referred to as surgical 
			extraction is more complicated than simple dental extraction. 
			it involves a tooth that is impacted inside the jaw and cannot 
			be removed without making an incision. 
			Surgical dental extraction involves the removal of teeth that 
			are not easily accessible inside the mouth.

		  A panoramic radiograph is a panoramic scanning dental X-ray 
		  of the upper and lower jaw. It shows a two-dimensional view 
		  of a half-circle from ear to ear.
		  Panoramic dental x-ray uses a very small dose of ionizing 
		  radiation to capture the entire mouth in one image. It is 
		  commonly performed by dentists and oral surgeons in everyday 
		  practice and may be used to plan treatment for dentures, 
		  braces, extractions and implants.

		  A Periapical X-ray shows your entire tooth, from the crown to the root tip. 
		  This type of X-ray helps your dentist detect decay, gum disease, 
		  bone loss and any other abnormalities of your tooth or surrounding bone.
		  It is a very commonly used diagnostic measure. This can be used for 
		  any tooth in the mouth and it is mostly used 
		  to determine the depth of the decay and if the tooth needs endodontic therapy,
		  if there are any periapical changes, impacted teeth, cysts and more.
