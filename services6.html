              <p class="text">
                Expanders are 
                orthodontic devices designed to create additional 
                space in the mouth by gradually widening the dental arch of your lower or upper jaw. 
                These appliances are removable, making them different from fixed expanders 
                that are bonded to the teeth. Removable expanders are commonly 
                used in orthodontic treatment to address issues such as crowding, 
                narrow dental arches, or
                misalignment of the teeth.

              <li class="list-text">Night Guards</li>
              <p class="text">
                Night guards, also known as occlusal splints or bite guards, 
                are removable dental appliances designed to be worn during sleep. 
                They are typically made of a durable and flexible material, 
                such as acrylic, and are custom-fitted to a patient's teeth.
                Night guards are used to address various dental issues related to
                grinding or clenching of the teeth during sleep, a condition known as 
                bruxism.
                <br>
                <br>
                Night guards are primarily used to manage the effects of bruxism, 
                which includes grinding or clenching of the teeth. This condition can 
                lead to tooth wear, jaw pain, headaches, and other related symptoms.

              <li class="list-text">Retainers</li>
              <p class="text">
                Retainers are orthodontic devices designed to maintain the alignment of 
                teeth after orthodontic treatment, such as braces or Invisalign. They are 
                custom-made appliances that can be removable or fixed (bonded to the teeth),
                and they play a crucial role in preventing teeth from shifting back to their 
                original positions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Retainers help preserve the alignment achieved during orthodontic treatment, 
                preventing teeth from reverting to their previous positions. Teeth have a natural
                tendency to shift over time, and retainers aid in preventing 
                relapse by holding them in their corrected positions. In some cases, retainers are used to 
                stabilize the relationship between the upper and lower jaws.
                <br>
                <br>
                Retainers are an essential part of the orthodontic process, ensuring that the results of 
                orthodontic treatment are maintained over the long term.

              <li class="list-text">TMJ Splints</li>
              <p class="text">
                TMJ splints, also known as temporomandibular joint (TMJ) splints or occlusal splints, 
                are dental appliances designed to alleviate symptoms associated with temporomandibular
                joint disorders (TMD). These splints are custom-fitted devices that are worn in the 
                mouth to provide support and promote proper jaw alignment.
                <br>
                <br>
                TMJ splints are often used to alleviate pain and discomfort associated with TMD, 
                including jaw pain, headaches, and facial pain. For individuals with bruxism (teeth grinding) or clenching habits, TMJ splints 
                can help reduce the impact on the jaw joint and associated structures.
                Splints aim to stabilize the temporomandibular joint and prevent excessive jaw movement
                that may contribute to TMD symptoms.
